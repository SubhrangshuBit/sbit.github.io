I am currently a first year PhD student in Computer Science in Boston University. I am based out of Kolkata, India. 
I mostly spend my time designing and developing machine learning and deep learning models to aid biomedical applications. I am interested in the interactions and commonalities of biological and artificial neural computations. My work is motivated by the remarkable ability of neural networks (biological and artificial) to learn and support complex, emergent computations. 
I also enjoy playing football and FIFA.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
