I am a first year Computer Science PhD student in Boston University. I am advised by <a href="https://vkola-lab.github.io/team/"> Dr. Vijaya Kolachalama</a>.

I mostly spend my time designing and developing machine learning and deep learning models to aid biomedical applications. My research interests fall under the umbrella of representation learning, computer vision and explainable AI.

I also enjoy playing European football.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
